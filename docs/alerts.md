# Displaying Alerts

Alerts are used to present important information to the user or prompt the user about an important choice.

Alerts and action sheets interrupt your appâ€™s normal flow to display a message to the user.

!!! caution "Using alerts"
    Because alerts and action sheets are an interruption, use them sparingly and only when absolutely needed.

## Display an alert

You can present different types of alerts. To display an alert you need to do the following:

1. Create an an object of type ` UIAlertController` and choose the preferred style
2. Actions actions of type ` UIAlertController `
3. Present the controller

### Create alert view controller

Create an object that is an instance of the `UIAlertController` and choose the preferred style. There are two styles:

- `UIAlertControllerStyle.Alert` - Creates an alert dialog that appears in the middle of the screen 
- `UIAlertControllerStyle.ActionSheet` - Creates an action sheet that appears from the bottom with the different options

The following code creates an alert style with a tile and a message:

```csharp
var alertController = UIAlertController.Create("Terms and Conditions", 
    "Click Agree to accept the terms and conditions.", 
    UIAlertControllerStyle.Alert);
```

## Create the actions

The different button options are created as actions. The following code creates two actions, a default and cancel action.

The default action

```csharp
var defaultAction = UIAlertAction.Create("Agree", UIAlertActionStyle.Default, (UIAlertAction action) =>
{
    // Perform action action on default action
});
```

and the cancel option:

```csharp
var cancelAction = UIAlertAction.Create("Disagree", UIAlertActionStyle.Cancel, (UIAlertAction obj) =>
{
    // Perform action for cancel
});
```

### Add the actions to the alert controller

You need to add the actions to the alert controller object as the following code shows:

```csharp
// Add actions
alertController.AddAction(defaultAction);
alertController.AddAction(cancelAction);
```

### Present the alert

Finally we can present the alert as follows:

```csharp
PresentViewController(alertController, true, null);
```

The above code will show the following figure when run:

![Alert view][1]

## Action Sheet

An action sheet is a specific style of alert that appears in response to a control or action, and presents a set of two or more choices related to the current context. Use an action sheet to let people initiate tasks, or to request confirmation before performing a potentially destructive operation.

On smaller screens, an action sheet slides up from the bottom of the screen. On larger screens, an action sheet appears all at once as a popover.

You can change the code above by changing the style to `ActionSheet`. You will also need to add more actions. 

### Dsiplaying action sheet on iPad

On devices with a larger screen, the action sheet is displayed as a pop over. To display the action as a pop over, you need to set the view for which the pop over will anchor to when displayed.

```csharp
var presentationPopOver = alertController.PopoverPresentationController;
// Check if the action sheet is displayed ona larger screen
if(presentationPopOver != null) {
    // Set the cource view
    presentationPopOver.SourceView = sender;

    // Choose the direction to anchor
    presentationPopOver.PermittedArrowDirections = UIPopoverArrowDirection.Down;
}
```

The action sheet will display as the figure below on the ipad:
