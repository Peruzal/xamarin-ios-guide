# iOS Views

In this section we discuss about the various UI controls used to build iOS user interfaces. Let's start about discussing about storyboards.

## Storyboard

![Storyboard][1]

A **Storyboard** is a file that contains the visual designs of our applicationâ€™s screens as well as the transitions and relationships between the screens. The storyboard files end in the .storyboard extensions.

!!! question "What is the difference between xib and storyboard files?"
    In the beginning, to design iOS screens, you had to create one file for each screen. These files were called _xib_ files. In later versions of iOS you could design multiple screens in one place, this file is called the _storyboard_.

### Scence

The combination of a `ViewController` and its views is called a `Scene` in the storyboard. You will have multiple `Scenes` for each of the screens for your app. When a new **Single View Application** project is created from a template, Visual Studio for Mac automatically generates a `Storyboard` file called **Main.storyboard** and populates it with a single `Scene`.

### ViewController

The view controller is an instance of the `UIViewController` class that contains the backing code. You wire the event and all the logic in the viewcontroller.

!!! info "MVC"
    iOS uses the MVC design pattern. The `ViewController` combines the `View` and `Controller` into one object called the ViewController.

### View

Each `ViewController` have a view it controls. The `View` is an instance of the `UIView` class that defines an area of the screen and provides interfaces for working with the content in that area. The default View is a single `Root View` that fills the whole device screen.

The outline of all the elements in the scene can be viewed by examining it in the **Document Outline** pad:

### Segue

A `segue`(pronounced _seg-way_) is the transition from one scene to the next. Its represented with an arrow on the storyboard. They are different types of segues and we will discuss them in later chapters.

### Window

The `AppDelegate` class manages the application `Window`.  The `Window` is a single instance of the `UIWindow` class that serves as a container for the user interface. 

By default, an application gets only one `Window` onto which to load its content, and the `Window` is attached to a `Screen` (single `UIScreen` instance) that provides the bounding rectangle matching the dimensions of the physical device screen.

The figure below shows the relationships between the different components:

These additional `Views` are inside the `Root View` are called `Subviews`.


## Common Views

Let's now look at the different sub views we use to create the UI. We are going to look at the following views:

- Label
- TextField
- TextView
- Button
- Slider
- ImageView
- ActionSheet
- Segmented Button
- Switch
- Stepper
- Date Picker
- Alert View
- Web View
