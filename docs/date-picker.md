# Pickers and Date Picker

## Picker View

A picker view displays one or more wheels that the user manipulates to select items. Each wheel—known as a component—has a series of indexed rows representing the selectable items. Users select items by rotating the wheels to the desired values, which align with a selection indicator.

The picker view is an instance of the `UIPickerView`.

## Date Picker

The UIDatePicker class uses a custom subclass of UIPickerView to display dates and times.
